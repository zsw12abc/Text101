    tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machinery. However, in front of
    you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from
    a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry
    it off.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?\r\n\r\n1. Pick it.\r\n2. Pry it."
